      <p id="note">Yoga is not a just a kind of sport, it is a lifestyle. 
        The most amazing thing about yoga is that there is a style for everyone, (both old & young), 
        practising it develops and advances all the time, even though poses stay the same, your attitude to them changes. 
        You can start doing yoga even if you are not sure about your flexibility and strength.
        Meditation and mindfulness are buzzwords these days for good reason. Yogis have been practicing dhyana (meditation) for millennia.

              <p>Yoga postures and sequences help to increase the body’s range of motion. 
                  The mindful approach of yoga helps to ensure that stretching is done safely, 
                  allowing the nervous system to release the muscles into gentle, effective stretches which ensures flexibilty.
