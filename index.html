  <p id="note">Yoga is not a just a kind of sport, it is a lifestyle.
    The most amazing thing about yoga is that there is a style for everyone (both old & young),
    practising it develops and advances all the time, even though poses stay the same, your attitude to them changes.
    You can start doing yoga even if you are not sure about your flexibility and strength.
    Meditation and mindfulness are buzzwords these days for good reason. Yogis have been practicing dhyana (meditation)
    for millennia.<br><br>
    Get expert insight here on meditation and its symbiotic relationship to yoga.
    Use this hub as your go-to resource for simple tips and guided practices to quiet your mind and make meditation part
    of your modern daily life.
